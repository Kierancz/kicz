# Kieran Czerwinski

Howdy, 

I’m a small town boy from the redwoods of northern California that moved to Colorado to become less of an idiot. It didn’t really work, but now I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science and a minor stick up my butt in Philosophy.

I’ve always loved the process of creating things. I’ve been incredibly lucky to have such supportive parents growing up that endured years of foot-pains due to my Lego addiction, constant mess and destruction my dad's garage and workbench, and my monopoly of the family computer as my creations became increasingly digital. Their support and the dawn of the internet allowed me to discover and explore a wide range of passions, giving me the hands on skills and confidence necessary to pursue an enduring journey of creation and learning.

The internet has had a profoundly affected the way I’ve developed as a personI’m also an aspiring developer with a focus on front-end engineering and design. I believe good design comes from a commitment to an iterative build, measure, and learn process where the user’s goals are paramount. As a fellow human, I believe our nature is fundamentally consistent with one another yet, our abilities can vary drastically. With technology all too often leaving behind those with a beautifully unique and yearning world view. 

In my free time I like to needlessly stress about the world and my largely pointless existence, learn something new, build/design something physical and/or digital, tinker with 3D modeling/printing, blow up electronics, read a good book/article, and on the rare occasion, I grab my camera and venture outside to sun my pasty skin.
