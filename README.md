This is a portfolio and blog developed by and for me, Kieran Czerwinski using Phemnomic, React, and lots of SASS. If for some strange reason you want to steal my code and run it yourself, you can use the following instructions:


## Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Run development server

```sh
npm start
```

## Build for production

```sh
npm run build
```
